ChainBridge-Core was born from and was built to improve the maintainability and modularity of the existing version of [ChainBridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge). The fundamental distinction between the two is that ChainBridge-Core is more of a framework rather than a stand-alone application.

## Installation
Refer to [installation](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-docs/blob/develop/docs/installation.md) guide for assistance in installing.

## Modules

The ChainBridge-Core-Example currently supports ~~three~~ two modules:
1. [EVM-CLI](#evm-cli)
2. [Celo-CLI](#celo-cli)
3. ~~[Substrate](#substrate)~~ -> ðŸš§ undergoing refactor

## Usage
Since ChainBridge-Core is the modular framework it will require writing some code to get it running. 

You can find some examples [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-core-example).

&nbsp;

## Metrics

Metrics, in `chainbridge-core` are handled via injecting metrics provider compatible with [Metrics](./relayer/relayer.go) interface into `Relayer` instance. It currently needs only one method, `TrackDepositMessage(m *message.Message)`
which is called inside relayer router when a `Deposit` event appears and should contain all necessary metrics data for extraction in custom implementations.

### OpenTelementry

`chainbridge-core` provides already implemented metrics [provider](./opentelemetry/opentelemetry.go) via [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that is vendor-agnostic. It sends metrics to a separate [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) that then sends metrics via configured [exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#exporters) to one or many metrics back-ends.

&nbsp;

## Local Setup

This section allows developers with a way to quickly and with minimal effort stand-up a local development environment in order to test out functionality of the ChainBridge.

### `local-setup`
The local-setup command deploys the bridge, ERC20, ERC721 and generic handler contracts- everything needed for a developer to get started issuing commands and interacting with the bridge.

```bash
Usage:
   local-setup [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for local-setup
```

Run by building the [chainbridge-core-example](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-core-example) app, or by issuing a `Makefile` instruction directly from the root of the [chainbridge-core](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-core) itself.

```bash
make local-setup
```
##### ^ this command will execute a shell script that contains instructions for running two EVM chains via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (`docker-compose`). Note: this entire process will likely take a few minutes to run.

&nbsp;

You can also review our [Local Setup Guide](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-docs/blob/develop/docs/guides/local-setup-guide.md) for a more detailed example of setting up a local development environment manually.

## Contributing

Chainbridge-core is a open project and welcomes contributions of all kinds: code, docs, and more. If you wish to submit more complex changes,
please check up with the core devs first on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ykXsJKfhgq) (look for CHAINBRIDGE category) or submit an issue on the repo to ensure those changes are in line with the general
philoshophy of the project or get some early feedback.

When implementing a change:

1. Adhere to the standard Go formatting guidelines, e.g. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). Run `go fmt`.
2. Stick to the idioms and patterns used in the codebase. Familiar-looking code has a higher chance of being accepted than eerie code. Pay attention to commonly used variable and parameter names, avoidance of naked returns, error handling patterns, etc.
3. Comments: follow the advice on the [Commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary) section of Effective Go.
4. Minimize code churn. Modify only what is strictly necessary. Well-encapsulated changesets will get a quicker response from maintainers.
5. Lint your code with [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) (CI will reject your PR if unlinted).
6. Add tests.
7. Title the PR in a meaningful way and describe the rationale and the thought process in the PR description.
8. Write clean, thoughtful, and detailed [commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If change entails an update that needs to be documented, please submit a PR to [chainbridge-docs](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-docs/tree/develop/docs) repo.
