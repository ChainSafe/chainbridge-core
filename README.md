Chainbridge-core is the project that was born from the existing version of [Chainbridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge). It was built to improve the maintainability and modularity of the current solution. The fundamental distinction is that chainbridge-core is more of a framework rather than a stand-alone application.

*Project still in deep beta*

## Usage
Since chainbridge-core is the modular framework it will require writing some code to get it running. Here you can find some examples
